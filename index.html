  **Summary**: My name is Alexander Lister. I am 17 year old senior going to Woodland Regional High School. I graduate from high school in 2019. I currently work at the [Shamrock](http://www.shamrockpubandgrill.com/) as a busser on the weekends. I live in prospect, Ct. My favorite food is Ramen and it has to be Maruchan ramen. I like to play a lot of games on [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) and I read many different books in my spare time. I like Math in school because I find it very easy. I have 2 [brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan), one who lives with his dad, and another who lives with his mother in NY. 
  
## My Family
  
  Like I said earlier, I have two siblings. I do not live with either of them. My father lives in New York and my Mum lives in New Hampshire at the moment. I live in prospect with my Aunt and Uncle. They have two children. One is almost 5 years old and the other is 4 months old. We have two dogs and a beta fish. I also have another uncle on my mum's side who has a son. He is about a year and a half old. On my Father's side I have two uncles and an aunt as well. My aunt and one of my uncles both have three children. My aunt has two daughters and a son while my uncle has two sons and a daughter. My Father's mother lives in Ct and my mum's mother lives NH.

## What I want to do in my Future

  I like to use computers and I want to learn more about them. I take APCS and I have taken an HTML class in freshman year. I would like to know how to program in java and many other coding languages in the future. I would like to learn to code because I want to become a game programmer/designer as an adult.
